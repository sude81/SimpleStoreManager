# SimpleStoreManager
This is a small C# console application I built for practice. It lets the user enter basic product information like name, quantity, and unit price, then calculates the total cost and prints it with some formatting and emojis for fun.

The main goal was to get more comfortable with:

Reading user input from the console

Doing basic validation (like checking for empty strings or invalid numbers)

Using simple classes and methods to organize the code

It’s not a complex project—just a beginner-friendly way to explore C# and console apps. I might expand it later to support multiple products or save data to a file, but for now it’s just a single-product calculator.

To run it, make sure you have the .NET SDK installed, then use:

bash
dotnet run

Feel free to use or modify it if it helps you learn too.
